# Treehouse Personal Profile Page

## Overview 
Customized a personal online profile by adding graphics, customizing text, and improving the look of the web page using Cascading Style Sheets.

For this project, I practiced my web design skills by customizing a web page to create a personal profile page. With the HTML and CSS already provided, I was asked to add, edit, and remove the pre-existing code. I modified the web page by adding images, customizing text, and adding my own stylish design.

## Skills
- HTML
- CSS

## Conclusion
At the end of this project, I had a strong understanding of how to customize pre-existing code, as well as add new code and remove pieces I no longer wanted. This project also gave me a web page where I can use as a personal online portfolio to advertise my experience, skills, and goals, and to provide links to my social media accounts.
